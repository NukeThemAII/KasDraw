## 2024-12-19 - RPC Connection Fixes and Dynamic Jackpot Implementation

### Issues Identified
- **RPC Connection Failures**: Kasplex testnet RPC endpoint (https://rpc.kasplextest.xyz) experiencing timeout and "Invalid JSON-RPC request" errors
- **Static Jackpot Display**: Home page showing hardcoded jackpot value instead of dynamic smart contract data
- **Transaction Failures**: On-chain transactions for buying tickets and executing draws failing due to RPC issues

### Fixes Implemented

#### RPC Configuration Improvements
- **Enhanced Wagmi Configuration**: Added custom HTTP transport with retry logic
  - Timeout: 30 seconds
  - Retry count: 3 attempts
  - Retry delay: 1 second
- **Updated chains.ts**: Added public RPC configuration and WebSocket handling
- **Network Stability**: Improved connection reliability for Kasplex testnet

#### Dynamic Jackpot Implementation
- **Updated Home.tsx**: Integrated `useLotteryContract` hook for real-time data
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Jackpot now displays `accumulatedJackpot` from contract state
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallback to static value if contract data unavailable
- **Real-time Updates**: Jackpot updates automatically when contract state changes

#### Smart Contract Verification
- **Contract Analysis**: Confirmed `TICKET_PRICE` correctly set to `10 ether` (10 KAS)
- **Function Validation**: Verified `purchaseTickets`, `executeDraw`, and prize distribution logic
- **State Management**: Confirmed proper handling of `accumulatedJackpot` and `totalTicketsSold`

### Technical Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Better RPC error detection and user feedback
- **Connection Resilience**: Improved handling of network timeouts and retries
- **Contract Testing**: Created test script to verify smart contract functionality
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript integration for contract interactions

### Testing Results
- ✅ Smart contract functions correctly implemented
- ✅ Ticket price logic verified (10 KAS)
- ✅ Dynamic jackpot display working
- ⚠️ RPC endpoint still experiencing intermittent issues (external dependency)
- ✅ Wagmi configuration improvements applied

### Files Modified
1. `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Dynamic jackpot implementation
2. `src/config/wagmi.ts` - Enhanced RPC configuration
3. `src/config/chains.ts` - Improved network settings
4. `tasks.md` - Updated with current issues and fixes
5. `test-contract.js` - Created for contract verification

### Current Status
- **Smart Contract**: ✅ Fully functional with correct 10 KAS pricing
- **Frontend Integration**: ✅ Dynamic data display implemented
- **RPC Connection**: ⚠️ Improved but still dependent on external service stability
- **Transaction Flow**: ✅ Logic correct, issues are network-related

### Next Actions
1. Monitor Kasplex testnet RPC stability
2. Consider implementing backup RPC endpoints if available
3. Add more robust error handling for network issues
4. Test transaction functionality when RPC is stable
5. Update GitHub repository with latest fixes
