  - Studied European EuroMillions: 5 numbers (1-50) + 2 Lucky Stars (1-12)
  - Reviewed traditional Lotto: 6 numbers from 1-49
  - Researched Totolotek (Polish lottery): Various game types

- **Task 1.2 COMPLETED**: Define KasDraw lottery rules
  - **Game Format**: 6 numbers from 1-49 (simplified for better odds)
  - **Ticket Price**: 0.1 KAS per ticket
  - **Draw Frequency**: Twice weekly (Tuesday 8 PM UTC, Friday 8 PM UTC)
  - **Prize Structure**:
    - Jackpot (6 matches): 50% of prize pool
    - Second Prize (5 matches): 20% of prize pool
    - Third Prize (4 matches): 15% of prize pool
    - Fourth Prize (3 matches): 14% of prize pool
    - Admin Fee: 1% of prize pool
  - **Rollover**: Jackpot rolls over if no winner, other prizes always distributed
  - **Minimum Jackpot**: 10 KAS (funded by admin initially)

### üìã Project Requirements Documented

3. **Task 1.5**: Install and configure required dependencies
4. **Task 2.1**: Begin smart contract architecture design

### üìù Important Notes

- **Security Considerations**: 
  - Need secure random number generation (explore Chainlink VRF availability on Kasplex)
  - Implement emergency pause functionality
  - Add reentrancy guards for prize claims

- **User Experience Focus**:
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Clear instructions for new crypto users
  - Transparent prize calculation display
  - Real-time jackpot updates

- **Business Logic**:
  - Admin fee collection mechanism
  - Rollover accumulation tracking
  - Prize distribution automation
  - Draw scheduling and execution

### üîç Research Findings

#### Lottery Odds Analysis
- **6/49 Format**: 1 in 13,983,816 for jackpot
- **5/49 Match**: 1 in 55,491 for second prize
- **4/49 Match**: 1 in 1,033 for third prize
- **3/49 Match**: 1 in 57 for fourth prize

This provides good balance between exciting jackpots and reasonable winning chances for lower tiers.

#### Smart Contract Architecture Considerations
- **Ticket Storage**: Efficient mapping structure for large number of tickets
- **Random Number Generation**: Critical for fairness and security
- **Gas Optimization**: Batch operations where possible
- **Event Emission**: Comprehensive logging for transparency
