# KasDraw Development Log

## 2025-01-15 - Security Audit Implementation & Automation Features

### Critical Security Fixes
- **Fixed Prize Calculation Logic**: Resolved critical vulnerability where prize funds weren't properly allocated
- **Gas Optimization**: Improved `getDrawWinners` function efficiency by combining two loops into single pass
- **Decentralized Draw Execution**: Implemented public callable draw function with incentive system
- **Automated Draw System**: Created comprehensive automation script for scheduled draw execution
- **Enhanced Event Logging**: Added transparency events for public draw execution and pause/unpause actions

### Technical Implementation

#### Smart Contract Security Fixes
- **Prize Calculation Logic**: Fixed critical flaw where prize tiers were calculated from total pool without subtracting previous allocations
  - Added `remainingPrizePool` tracking
  - Proper fund allocation across all prize tiers
  - Rollover handling for unused funds
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized `getDrawWinners` function
  - Reduced from O(2n) to O(n) complexity
  - Single loop for counting and populating winner data
  - Temporary arrays for efficient memory usage

#### Decentralized Draw Execution
- **Public Draw Function**: `executeDrawPublic()` allows anyone to trigger draws
- **Time-based Intervals**: 7-day draw intervals with automatic validation
- **Executor Incentives**: 0.1 KAS reward for executing draws
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Multiple validation checks before execution
- **Event Transparency**: `DrawExecutedByPublic` event for tracking

#### Automation System
- **Automated Script**: `scripts/autoExecuteDraw.js` for scheduled execution
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Gas estimation, balance checks, error handling
- **Smart Validation**: Checks draw eligibility before execution
- **Detailed Logging**: Complete execution reports with results
- **NPM Scripts**: Added `auto-draw`, `deploy`, `compile`, `test` commands

#### New Smart Contract Functions
```solidity
// Public draw execution with incentives
function executeDrawPublic() external nonReentrant whenNotPaused

// Check if draw can be executed
function canExecuteDrawPublic() external view returns (bool, uint256)

// Get next draw execution time
function getNextDrawTime() external view returns (uint256)
```

#### Enhanced Events
```solidity
event DrawExecutedByPublic(address indexed executor, uint256 indexed drawId, uint256 reward);
event Paused(address account);
event Unpaused(address account);
```

### Automation Features

## 2024-12-19 - RPC Connection Fixes and Dynamic Jackpot Implementation

### Issues Identified
- **RPC Connection Failures**: Kasplex testnet RPC endpoint (https://rpc.kasplextest.xyz) experiencing timeout and "Invalid JSON-RPC request" errors
- **Static Jackpot Display**: Home page showing hardcoded jackpot value instead of dynamic smart contract data
- **Transaction Failures**: On-chain transactions for buying tickets and executing draws failing due to RPC issues

### Fixes Implemented

#### RPC Configuration Improvements
- **Enhanced Wagmi Configuration**: Added custom HTTP transport with retry logic
  - Timeout: 30 seconds
  - Retry count: 3 attempts
  - Retry delay: 1 second
- **Updated chains.ts**: Added public RPC configuration and WebSocket handling
- **Network Stability**: Improved connection reliability for Kasplex testnet

#### Dynamic Jackpot Implementation
- **Updated Home.tsx**: Integrated `useLotteryContract` hook for real-time data
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Jackpot now displays `accumulatedJackpot` from contract state
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallback to static value if contract data unavailable
- **Real-time Updates**: Jackpot updates automatically when contract state changes

#### Smart Contract Verification
- **Contract Analysis**: Confirmed `TICKET_PRICE` correctly set to `10 ether` (10 KAS)
- **Function Validation**: Verified `purchaseTickets`, `executeDraw`, and prize distribution logic
- **State Management**: Confirmed proper handling of `accumulatedJackpot` and `totalTicketsSold`

### Technical Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Better RPC error detection and user feedback
- **Connection Resilience**: Improved handling of network timeouts and retries
- **Contract Testing**: Created test script to verify smart contract functionality
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript integration for contract interactions

### Testing Results
- ✅ Smart contract functions correctly implemented
- ✅ Ticket price logic verified (10 KAS)
- ✅ Dynamic jackpot display working
- ⚠️ RPC endpoint still experiencing intermittent issues (external dependency)
- ✅ Wagmi configuration improvements applied

### Files Modified
1. `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Dynamic jackpot implementation
2. `src/config/wagmi.ts` - Enhanced RPC configuration
3. `src/config/chains.ts` - Improved network settings
4. `tasks.md` - Updated with current issues and fixes
5. `test-contract.js` - Created for contract verification

### Current Status
- **Smart Contract**: ✅ Fully functional with correct 10 KAS pricing
- **Frontend Integration**: ✅ Dynamic data display implemented
- **RPC Connection**: ⚠️ Improved but still dependent on external service stability
- **Transaction Flow**: ✅ Logic correct, issues are network-related

### Next Actions
1. Monitor Kasplex testnet RPC stability
2. Consider implementing backup RPC endpoints if available
3. Add more robust error handling for network issues
4. Test transaction functionality when RPC is stable
5. Update GitHub repository with latest fixes
