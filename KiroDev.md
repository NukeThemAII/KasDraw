## Critical Findings

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Accounting Discrepancies

**Issue:** Prize pool and admin fee calculations are incorrect, leading to financial inconsistencies.

**Evidence:**
- Expected 4 tickets sold, but contract reports 9 tickets
- Expected prize pool: 39.6 KAS, actual: 89.1 KAS  
- Expected admin fees: 0.4 KAS, actual: 0.9 KAS

**Impact:** 
- Incorrect prize distributions
- Potential loss of funds
- Broken economic model

**Root Cause:** Likely issue with ticket counter or fee calculation logic in the smart contract.

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Prize Claiming Failure

**Issue:** Prize claiming fails with "Not ticket owner" error even for legitimate winners.

**Evidence:**
- Player1 correctly identified as jackpot winner (5 matches)
- Prize claiming transaction reverts with ownership error
- Prevents winners from receiving their prizes

**Impact:**
- Winners cannot claim prizes
- Funds locked in contract
- Complete system failure for end users

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Draw Data Structure Issues

**Issue:** Draw data retrieval fails, indicating structural problems with draw storage.

**Evidence:**
- `getDraw()` function returns undefined properties
- Cannot access draw execution status
- Data integrity compromised

**Impact:**
- Frontend cannot display draw results
- Audit trail broken
- Transparency compromised

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Prize Amount Calculation Error

**Issue:** Jackpot prize amounts are significantly higher than expected.

**Evidence:**
- Expected jackpot: 19.8 KAS (50% of 39.6 KAS)
- Actual jackpot: 44.5 KAS (125% more than expected)

**Impact:**
- Unsustainable prize payouts
- Potential contract insolvency
- Economic model breakdown

## Security Strengths ✅

### Access Control
- ✅ Owner-only functions properly restricted
- ✅ Non-owners cannot access admin functions
- ✅ Proper role-based permissions implemented

### Input Validation
- ✅ Ticket number range validation (1-35)
- ✅ Duplicate number detection
- ✅ Payment amount verification
- ✅ Proper rejection of invalid inputs

### Emergency Mechanisms
- ✅ Pause/unpause functionality working
- ✅ Emergency withdrawal available
- ✅ Paused state prevents operations
- ✅ Admin fee withdrawal functional

### Draw Security
- ✅ Premature draw execution prevented
- ✅ Manual draw execution by owner works
- ✅ Proper time-based restrictions

## Gas Efficiency Analysis ⛽

### Gas Usage Metrics
- **Single Ticket Purchase:** 455,609 gas
- **5 Ticket Purchase:** 1,363,696 gas  
- **Gas per Additional Ticket:** ~227,022 gas

### Assessment
- ⚠️ **HIGH GAS USAGE:** Single ticket purchases consume excessive gas
- ⚠️ **SCALING ISSUES:** Gas usage doesn't scale linearly with ticket count
- 💡 **OPTIMIZATION NEEDED:** Consider batch processing improvements

---

## Technical Issues

### 1. BigInt Type Conversion Error
**Location:** Admin fee percentage comparison  
**Issue:** Cannot mix BigInt and other types  
**Fix:** Use explicit type conversions

### 2. Ticket Counter Logic
**Issue:** Ticket counting appears to include previous test runs  
**Fix:** Ensure proper state isolation between tests

### 3. Data Structure Access
**Issue:** Draw summary structure not properly accessible  
**Fix:** Review struct definitions and access patterns

---

## Smart Contract Issues Identified

### Mathematical Errors
```solidity
// ISSUE: Incorrect percentage calculation
uint256 adminFee = totalCost.mul(ADMIN_FEE_PERCENTAGE).div(10000);
// Should be: totalCost * 100 / 10000 = totalCost * 1 / 100

// ISSUE: Prize distribution logic
// Current implementation may double-count or miscalculate prizes
```

### Data Structure Problems
```solidity
// ISSUE: Draw struct access pattern
struct Draw {
    // ... fields
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) winnersCount;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) prizeAmounts;
}

// Problem: Nested mappings in structs may cause access issues
```

### State Management Issues
```solidity
// ISSUE: Ticket counter persistence
uint256 private ticketCounter;
// May not reset properly between draws or tests
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests Needed
1. **Mathematical Operations**
   - Fee calculations
   - Prize distributions
   - Percentage calculations

2. **State Transitions**
   - Draw lifecycle
   - Ticket purchasing
   - Prize claiming

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Zero winners
   - Maximum tickets
   - Boundary conditions

### Integration Tests Required
1. **End-to-End Scenarios**
   - Complete lottery cycle
   - Multiple draw scenarios
   - Rollover mechanics

2. **Stress Testing**
   - High ticket volumes
   - Multiple concurrent users
   - Gas limit scenarios
